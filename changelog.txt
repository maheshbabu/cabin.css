1.0			Cabin releases to select few for feedback
1.0.1		Added .nomargin and .center, changed menu selector from id to class, corrected various typos
1.0.2		Included a default reset in the cabin.css file and deleted the reset.cabin.css extension as it was unnecessary to have separate files	
1.0.3		Corrected possible HTML5 conflict with <nav> tag - menu classes are now "horizontal", "centered" and "vertical" 
			Removed unnecessary p styling (.center)
