1.0     Cabin releases to select few for feedback
1.0.1   Added .nomargin and .center, changed menu selector from id to class, corrected various typos
1.0.2   Included a default reset in the cabin.css file and deleted the reset.cabin.css extension as it was unnecessary to have separate files	
1.0.3   Corrected possible HTML5 conflict with <nav> tag - menu classes are now "horizontal", "centered" and "vertical" 
        Removed unnecessary p styling (.center)
        Improved h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6 baseline - thanks to @joshuanhibbert for the help!

          Cleaned up typography
